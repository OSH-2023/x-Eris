## Overview

ROS (Robot Operating System) is an open-source software development kit for robotics applications. ROS offers a standard software platform to developers across industries that will carry them from research and prototyping all the way through to deployment and production.

The suggested developing platform is ubuntu. 

## Idea

1. Modify the ROS system to suit some specific task, which may be very hard considering the amount of code. 
2. Install the system on a robot, and write programs to manage the motors, the sensors, the processors, the network, etc. This may not be that hard, with abundant tutorials online.
